Personal Nvim Config for Competitive Programming

You would need "cpbooster" for this. Install it using your favourite package manager.

Like "paru/yay cpbooster"

Then Install "https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster.vim" for vim or Neovim as per your config.

After installing, execute "cpb init" to generate the config file which i mainly used to store and load my cpp template. 

Make sure you have "Competitve Companion" installed on your browser.

Then execute "cpb clone" . Then press the Competitive Companion icon then it will Generate the testcases and .cpp file inside a organized folder.

Control + Alt + B will act as :Test and will show the testcases.

Control + C = compile .


Control + X = Execute
